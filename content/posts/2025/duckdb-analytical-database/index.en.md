## Product Highlights
Analytical Database
This is an in-process SQL OLAP database management system designed for data analysis with a columnar storage engine. It supports standard SQL query syntax and runs embedded within applications without requiring separate server deployment.

Fast Data Processing
In real-world data analysis scenarios, it quickly handles complex aggregation queries on both local CSV files and remote Parquet data. Its parallel execution capability significantly improves query speed for large datasets, reducing data processing wait times dramatically.

Easy Installation
The system design is remarkably simple, requiring almost no configuration from installation to operation. It supports multiple programming language interfaces including Python, R and Java, with clear documentation that helps beginners start querying data quickly.

Technical Strength
Fully open source under MIT license, it supports extensions and custom functions while reading from remote storage like S3. Despite its powerful features, it has minimal resource consumption and can handle larger-than-memory workloads on single machines, making it ideal for data science and daily analytics.
