## Product Highlights
The moment you open Preline, it feels like stepping into a treasure trove for frontend developers. 840+ components neatly organized - from buttons to tables, navbars to date pickers, everything you need. The killer feature is full framework compatibility: switch between React and Vue seamlessly, with dark mode built-in. I tried their Figma design system and it perfectly mirrors the code components, finally ending the designer-developer blame game. Check the user wall comments - everyone's asking 'How is this free?'. Seriously, this quality would be paid elsewhere. If you use Tailwind, this thing will double your development efficiency, saving enough time for countless coffee breaks.
