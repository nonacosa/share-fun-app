## Product Highlights
Handwritten aesthetic
This CSS framework adds handwritten paper texture to web interfaces, moving away from cold technical appearance. It creates unique visual experiences by simulating paper grain and natural strokes. Perfect for projects needing warm human touch.

Quick integration

Design philosophy
