## Article Summary
Handcrafted Simplification
This article details the development process of LXGW Klee Simplified typeface. Based on the Japanese Klee font from FONTWORKS, the author manually completed 3500 commonly used simplified Chinese characters, creating this open-source typeface that combines features of regular and imitation Song styles.

Consistency Challenges
The biggest challenge was maintaining consistency with the original font style. By deconstructing strokes and assembling components, the author carefully adjusted each character to ensure the added simplified characters blend perfectly with the original font, avoiding awkwardness when mixing different typefaces.

Elegant Readability
What makes this font special is its preservation of elegant Japanese textbook-style brush strokes while conforming to Chinese reading habits. Each character undergoes repeated refinement with harmonious stroke structures, providing comfortable reading experience especially for long texts.

Open Source Accessibility
Although the author claims to be a non-professional type designer, the completion level is surprisingly high. The completely open-source project, handmade with FontCreator, avoids copyright risks and is free for anyone to use and modify.

## Recommendation Reasons
<!--more-->- Handcrafted completion of 3500 common characters

- Perfect blend of Japanese and Chinese writing styles

- Completely open source with no copyright risks
