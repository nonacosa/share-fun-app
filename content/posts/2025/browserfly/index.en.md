## Product Highlights
Picture this: an AI sidekick living right in your browser, no virtual machines or new browsers needed. Just tell it 'summarize this page' or 'fill out this form', and it operates like a human would. I tried the auto-form feature â€“ felt like having a personal assistant handling tedious tasks. You can even click any element to analyze or modify it through natural language. Imagine using it for email sorting or research automation. This isn't another browser; it's your existing Chrome/Edge upgraded to a smart workstation.

## Pricing Model
<!--more-->30 free credits/month, $2/50 credits, BYOK supported

## Recommendation Reasons
- Native AI integration without virtual machines or browser switching
