## Product Highlights
Unified API Access
This platform provides a single API endpoint to access all major AI models from providers like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. It aggregates over 500 models from 60+ providers, eliminating the need to integrate multiple APIs separately.

Efficiency in Development
With just one OpenRouter API key, developers can switch between models seamlessly. Use GPT-5 for complex reasoning, Claude for long-context tasks, or Gemini for multimodal needsâ€”all without code changes, significantly speeding up workflow.

Clean Interface Design
The interface focuses on model performance metrics and pricing comparisons. Real-time data like weekly growth rates and latency are prominently displayed, making model selection straightforward without clutter or distractions.

Technical Compatibility
Fully compatible with OpenAI's SDK, allowing existing projects to integrate with minimal modifications. Latency is optimized with edge nodes adding only ~25ms. Custom data policies ensure sensitive prompts are routed only to trusted providers.
