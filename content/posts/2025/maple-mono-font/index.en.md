## Product Highlights
Coding comfort redefined
This open-source monospace font addresses common pain points programmers face with existing options. It features variable font technology, built-in Nerd-Font icons, and Chinese character support, making code reading and writing significantly smoother.

Productivity boost
Subtle design choices directly impact coding efficiency. Rounded corners reduce eye strain during long sessions, while smart ligatures automatically beautify log tags and operators, keeping code visually organized and professional.

Aesthetic precision
Every glyph is meticulously crafted with distinct character differentiation to avoid confusion. The cursive-style italics add elegance without sacrificing readability, and slashed zeros prevent visual ambiguity in code contexts.

Technical excellence
Full OpenType feature customization allows fine-grained control over font behavior. Built-in Nerd-Font support means terminal tools display icons seamlessly, and the 2:1 monospace ratio ensures perfect alignment in mixed Chinese-English environments.
