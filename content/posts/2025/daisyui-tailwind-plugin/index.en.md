## Product Highlights
Ever tired of writing endless Tailwind utility classes? daisyUI hits you with semantic names like 'btn' and 'card' that slash code volume by 88%. I tried building a form - what used to take 20 lines now takes 3, like liposuction for your HTML. Swap between 30+ themes with one click, from cyberpunk to pastel, no more team fights over styling. Best part? Pure CSS with zero JS dependency, works in any framework. Even my PM could tweak components without breaking a sweat.

## Pricing Model
<!--more-->Not specified

## Recommendation Reasons
- Semantic class names replace verbose utilities for blazing-fast development
