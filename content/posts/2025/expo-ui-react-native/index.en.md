## Product Highlights
Native Integration
Expo SDK 54 enables React Native developers to directly use SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose native UI components. This allows mixing modern UI primitives with React components in the same application, bridging the gap between native and cross-platform development.

Development Efficiency
Dramatically improves productivity by eliminating the need to write separate UI code for different platforms. A single codebase now adapts to both iOS and Android, significantly reducing repetitive work in fast-paced development teams.

User Experience
Delivers fluid and natural interface performance with seamless system UI integration. Animations and interactive feedback meet platform standards, providing near-native app experience while maintaining development efficiency.

Technical Accessibility
Features moderate learning curve with gradual integration options for existing React Native projects. Comprehensive documentation and community support make adoption straightforward without requiring complete rewrites.
