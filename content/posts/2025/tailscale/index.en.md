Remember that magic feeling when AirDrop just worked? Tailscale gives me the same vibe. No firewall rules, no routing tables - install the client and devices automatically form an encrypted mesh network. Tested it at home: phone, laptop, and cloud server connected instantly, SSH felt like local access. The killer part is its WireGuard foundation, outperforming traditional VPNs while keeping everything free for personal use. Imagine accessing company resources remotely or debugging your home NAS while traveling - this seamless connectivity is addictive.
