## Product Highlights
Remember Docker Desktop draining your Mac's battery? OrbStack is like swapping a clunky truck for a sports car. Containers run natively smooth on M1/M2 chips, launching in seconds while doubling battery life. I tested building environments - 17 minutes instead of 45, and I could actually work while compiling. Rosetta x86 emulation, VirtioFS file sharing, all the tech magic is here with seamless CLI integration. VPN and IPv6 just work. The killer feature? Background CPU usage under 0.1% and only 10MB disk space - it's like having an invisible assistant. Now I code without fan noise, finally experiencing what Apple silicon development should feel like.
