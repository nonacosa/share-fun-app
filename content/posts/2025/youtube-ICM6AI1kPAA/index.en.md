## Product Highlights
Step into a Victorian detective agency where you learn English by solving mysteries. Peter Carlson's text adventure comes alive with Luke's authentic British narration—you make choices, unravel clues, and absorb the language naturally. Tried it during my commute and felt like having a storytelling session with a London native. The interactive format beats textbook drills any day, perfect for auditory learners who hate memorization. Great for bedtime listening too—who says learning can't be fun?
