## Product Highlights
Open Source Library
This is an open source UI component library specifically designed for voice interaction and audio processing, built on shadcn/ui. It provides rich customizable components that developers can directly integrate into their projects to quickly build professional voice application interfaces, eliminating the need to develop from scratch.

Voice Efficiency
In actual customer service scenarios, voice components significantly enhance user experience. Users can start conversations with a single tap on the voice button while the system transcribes speech in real-time. Support agents can handle multiple sessions simultaneously, making it ideal for online support scenarios requiring efficient communication.

Design Details
The component library features refined visual design with Agent Orbs using colorful spheres to intuitively display conversation states. Waveform visualization provides real-time audio input feedback. The dark theme with smooth color transitions ensures comfortable long-term usage with timely and natural interaction responses.

Technical Features
Built with React and TypeScript, the component APIs are clean and straightforward. Audio components come with ElevenLabs' voice technology built-in, ready to use out of the box while supporting deep customization. Clear documentation allows frontend developers to build their first voice application within 30 minutes of setup.
