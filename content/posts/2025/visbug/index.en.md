## Product Highlights
This thing is like a Swiss Army knife for front-end devs and designers. Open it up and it feels like a playground where every tool is right there to tinker with. I tried color adjustmentsâ€”just click elements and tweak colors live, even SVG edits work seamlessly. Keyboard navigation flows like a game, Tab to traverse and Enter to select, pure efficiency. Copy-paste elements and styles across tabs? Dark mode contagion with one click? Absolutely genius. Mobile has limits but HTML5 color input still lets you have fun. No undo hurts a bit, but for free and open-source, it is ridiculously powerful. Who needs anything else?
