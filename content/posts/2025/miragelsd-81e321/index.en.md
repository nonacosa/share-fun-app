You turn on your camera and instantly the real world transforms into an anime scene, with latency so low you barely feel it. Imagine streaming with your background suddenly becoming a cyberpunk city, or converting game footage into oil painting style in real-time. I tried it with my phone camera - that instant feedback feels like adding a filter to reality, but way smarter. It understands the content, maintains temporal consistency without flickering. Could see this being huge for virtual meetings or making educational videos more engaging by instantly changing styles.
