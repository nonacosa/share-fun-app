Saw teachers using it in class, kids&amp;rsquo; jaws dropping when they realized Brazil is actually smaller than Alaska. Perfect for trip planning or settling bar bets about country sizes. Right-click to delete, left-click to drag – makes Mercator&amp;rsquo;s distortions feel like a bad joke we&amp;rsquo;ve all believed for too long.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Stepping into ModernCSS.dev feels like walking into a CSS workshop where every article is a gold nugget from Stephanie Eckles&amp;rsquo; 15 years of frontend battles. I tried the @property tutorial for defining CSS types—suddenly my old fallback values felt primitive. This thing makes custom properties as safe as TypeScript! Those one-line CSS upgrades? Change a single property and watch JavaScript bloat vanish while UX skyrockets. Picture this: it&amp;rsquo;s 2 AM, you&amp;rsquo;re grinding on a project, and clamp() magically handles fluid typography without media query headaches. The site even teaches pure CSS custom forms, responsive spacing, and accessibility-friendly components. Frontend devs, time to ditch those outdated frameworks!&lt;/p>
