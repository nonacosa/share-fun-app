Based in Hong Kong, he builds sleek sites with TypeScript and Node.js, and that 4602-hour coding streak is no joke. I browsed his projects: Links neatly bundles social handles, while One Blog sits like a minimalist digital notebook. What got me hooked are his tech stack choices—from Prisma to Cloudflare, each tool picked with surgical precision.
