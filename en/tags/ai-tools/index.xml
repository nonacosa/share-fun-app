Tried their mock interview feature and it felt like having a native speaker drilling with me, catching every pronunciation slip and grammar hiccup. The killer feature? It plugs directly into your actual calls, fixing mistakes on the fly. Available 24/7 at 1/15 the cost of human tutors. Game-changer for non-native professionals.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Picture this: all those scattered user feedback from emails, chats, and support tickets get automatically captured, deduped, and organized by AI—plus it even asks follow-up questions to clarify needs. Canny feels like having a tireless assistant curating your feedback hub. I tried their Autopilot feature; it snagged casual user complaints from Slack and generated priority scores instantly. The killer part? Building public roadmaps so users see their ideas in action—this alone cuts down support tickets dramatically. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a startup saving PM hours or a large company syncing cross-team insights, it&amp;rsquo;s a game-changer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Walking into MuleRun feels like browsing a toolbox where each AI Agent waits to tackle your grunt work. Tried the resume matcher—it instantly aligned my profile with LinkedIn jobs, like having a personal headhunter. The Reddit hunter digs up SaaS opportunities from real conversations, every entrepreneur&amp;rsquo;s dream. Blender MCP blew my mind: type text, get 3D models. Perfect for design newbies! Imagine handling emails or building nav sites? These mules got you covered.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This thing hits different! Open the site and it&amp;rsquo;s like walking into a digital hardware store—shelves packed with ready-to-use UI components for React and Tailwind. Right-click triggers a slick brand menu that feels native. Tried the AI component generator: describe what you need, bam, code pops out. No more arguing about design styles with the team—everything molds to your own taste, not some generic LLM output. Saved our frontend dev 3 hours on a prototype last week. Low-key wondering if it could auto-convert Figma files next&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
